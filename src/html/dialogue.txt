Hi
Hello
I hope you had a nice day!
Thanks! 
I feel silly for my attitude towards you sometimes.
...
I think you are a really wonderful, passionate person. 
true..
and I would love to exist with you in a constant interchange of words and information and ideas (and bodily fluids!) in a mature and loving and interested way, without feeling fruitlessly defensive and self-involved. It would be nice to learn and grow together, instead of being hampered by retrograde behavior on the part of a person who cares about you!
Good thought.
So I'm sorry for making you feel bad! It's stupid to do that to someone I care about!
It's okay!
I look forward to many more conversations with you about whatever we want to talk about. I will listen with an open mind and an open heart! 
And open legs? 
Yes! 
Hurray!
I love you!
